- Feature extraction using TF-IDF and Word2Vec
- Machine learning models: SVM, Random Forest, Logistic Regression
- Deep learning model: LSTM
- Model accuracy evaluation
- Inference/prediction of sentiment from new reviews

## üìä Dataset
The dataset consists of cleaned and labeled Ajaib app reviews:
- Labels: Positive, Negative, Neutral
- Total entries: ~100,000 reviews
